				<p>
					<em>Dendrophylax lindenii</em>, commonly known as the ghost orchid (a
					name also used for <em>Epipogium aphyllum</em>), is a rare and elusive
					perennial epiphyte belonging to the orchid family (Orchidaceae).
					Native to both Florida and Cuba, it is also referred to by names such
					as palm polly and white frog orchid.<br>
					The species name "lindenii" honors Belgian botanist Jean Jules Linden,
					who first encountered the orchid in Cuba in 1844. It was later
					rediscovered in the Everglades region of Florida.

					The ghost orchid blooms from June through August, producing between
					one and ten fragrant flowers that bloom sequentially. The striking
					white flowers measure about 3–4 cm (1.2–1.6 in) wide and 7–9 cm
					(2.8–3.5 in) long, growing on spikes that emerge from the root system.
					Their strongest fragrance occurs in the early morning and has a
					fruity, apple-like scent.<br>
					A unique feature of the flower is its labellum, the lower petal, which
					has two long side tendrils that curve slightly downward, resembling a
					frog's hind legs in motion. The flower's bracts are thin and papery,
					known as scarious. Due to the orchid's camouflaged root system that
					blends seamlessly with the tree bark, the blossoms often appear to
					float in mid-air—giving rise to its ghostly name.
